= Transforming Lightweight Markup Languages for Scientific Publishing

This repository aims to demonstrate how lightweight markup languages such as Markdown and AsciiDoc can be used for scientific publishing.
For now, it consists of a PDF article and a corresponding web page. 

== Install

The examples are built on top of the Docker ecosystem, so Docker is required to build the output.

- https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/

Since each folder represents one possible way to convert a source format using a particular tool, the Docker commands containing these tools are located there.

== Usage

To build the output, navigate to the example of your choice and run the build script file.

[source, bash]
----
$ ./build.sh
----

This will run the appropriate Docker commands and create an out folder in the current working directory containing the files created.
